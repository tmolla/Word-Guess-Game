# Word-Guess-Game

## A web based game for gussing a word. 
For this game nature theme is chosen. The player is to guess the name of the animal such as "Dog", "Raccoon" etc. When the player guesses the name correctly, a sound the animal makes is played and a picture of the animal is shown (_there are some humor in some of the sounds played and images shown_) 

The user has a few tries to guess the name. a count of winnings and losses are kept. Win or lose, the user can keep playing the game by clicking on the play button. A _hint_ is given to help the palyer succeed. Also the attempted letters are shown so the user will not make the same mistake. Currently there are only 12 animals in the database so words will repeat frequently.
